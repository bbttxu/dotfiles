# bbttxu does dotfiles

Updates are a **WIP**

## dotfiles

Your dotfiles are how you personalize your system. These are mine. 

If you're interested in the philosophy behind why projects like these are
awesome, you might want to [read zach holman's post on the
subject](http://zachholman.com/2010/08/dotfiles-are-meant-to-be-forked/).

I'm using `stow` now instead of ruby's rake.

## install

- `git clone git://github.com/bbttxu/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles`
- `cd ~/.dotfiles`


## topical

Everything's built around topic areas. If you're adding a new area to your
forked dotfiles — say, "Java" — you can simply add a `java` directory and put
files in there.

## what's inside

A lot of stuff. Seriously, a lot of stuff. Check them out in the file browser
above and see what components may mesh up with you. Fork it, remove what you
don't use, and build on what you do use.

## thanks

I forked [Ryan Bates](http://github.com/ryanb)' excellent
[dotfiles](http://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles) for a couple years before the
weight of \[Zach's\] changes and tweaks inspired me to finally roll my own. But Ryan's
dotfiles were an easy way to get into bash customization, and then to jump ship
to zsh a bit later. A decent amount of the code in these dotfiles stem or are
inspired from Ryan's \[Zach's\] original project.
